### About Project
The purpose of this project was to learn how to create a CRUD app. Honestly, I ran into quite a few problems with this project but I pushed through and in the end I learned way more about development than I thought possible.


### Requirements
* Clean code - single responsibility principle
* ES6 Modules bundled with webpack
* No errors - linters should be clean
* Jquery for any DOM manipulation (selectors, modifying css classes, events)
* SASS and Bootstrap for styling
* Completely planned out - before each section you should be making new cards before you code.  You should have wireframes and an ERD
